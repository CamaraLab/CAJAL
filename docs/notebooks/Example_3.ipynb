    "The Gromov-Wasserstein distance between two cells with 100 points takes about 9ms to compute on a standard desktop. The number of pairs grows quadratically with the number of cells, and so the total runtime can become large.\n",
    "\n",
    "For large datasets we provide two tools to reduce the necessary computation, as well as a hybrid of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "In <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1) the author establishes several lower bounds for the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. We have implemented one of the fastest, which we name \"SLB2\"<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#cite_note-2). For the purposes of clustering analysis it may be enough to know the precise Gromov-Wasserstein distance only for cells which are close to each other in the morphology space, because most clustering algorithms are insensitive to the precise distance between points which are very far apart. Similarly, many dimensionality reduction techniques only respect local distances but do not preserve global structure of the space, and so it is not crucial to know the exact values between disparate cells."

    "The second tool we provide is an implementation of the quantized Gromov-Wasserstein distance proposed by Chowdhury, Miller and Needham[^4]. Given cells $X$ and $Y$, the quantized Gromov-Wasserstein distance is given by partitioning the points of $X$ and $Y$ into clusters, computing the optimal Gromov-Wasserstein coupling matrix between the subspaces formed by the medoids of each cluster, and extending this to a global transport plan by pairing points within paired clusters by their distance from the medoid. This approximation gives an acceptable tradeoff between precision and computation time.\n",
