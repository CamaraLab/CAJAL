    """
    Convert a NeuronTree to a WeightedTree. A node in a WeightedTree does not contain \
    a coordinate triple, a radius, a structure_id, or a parent sample number.

    Instead, it contains a direct pointer to its parent, a list of its children,
    and (if it is a child node) the weight of the edge between the child and its parent.

    In forming the WeightedTree, any node with both a parent and exactly one child is eliminated, \
    and the parent and the child are joined directly by a single edge whose weight is the sum of \
    the two original edge weights. This reduces the number of nodes without affecting the \
    geodesic distances between points in the graph.
